In this sample, we customize the chart using following features.

* LabelTemplate: This feature allows users to customize the appearance of data labels. By defining a label template, users can control the layout, style, and content of the labels, making the data representation more informative and visually appealing.

* BarAlignment: This feature allows users to specify the position of the data label in column-type series. It helps in aligning the labels precisely where needed for better clarity. The available values are:

    * Middle: Aligns the label in the middle of the column.
    * Top: Aligns the label at the top of the column.
    * Bottom: Aligns the label at the bottom of the column.
 
* LabelPlacement: This feature provides support for placing data labels in specific positions relative to the chart segments. It is an enumeration type with the following values:

    * Center: Places the label at the center of the Label Bar Alignmnet.
    * Inner: Places the label inside of the Label Bar Alignmnet.
    * Outer: Places the label outside of the Label Bar Alignmnet.
